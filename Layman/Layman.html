<h4>Problem statement and motivation:</h4>
<p align=”justify”>
Last year one of the research projects foccussed on predicting weather information based on what other experts (websites) predicted.
This year we try do something similar on economic data. In the US there is a survay of professional forcasters (SPF),
which has been arround for 50 years now and consists of 16 economic variables that are estimated every quarter over 5 different time horizons.
The predictions that do on this data (e.g. GDP) largely involve taking the mean or the medium, however we think that we can improve upon this using data science techniques.

<h4>Research questions/hypotheses:</h4>
<ol>
<li>What is an effective way to aggregate the predictions on SPF website?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Can a model be implemented that performs well and does not reply on an overly complex model?</li>
    <li>How does our model compare to what has been implemented on so far?</li>
    <li>Is it more appropriate to treat the SPF data as a time series?</li>
  </ol>
<li>Can the conformal predictive regions be computed that reflect the theory of conformal prediction?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Can conformal prediction identify ‘black swan’ events where a previously unforeseen phenomenon has a significant impact on the economy?</li>
    <li>Is there any way to predict the likelihood that the range of predictions that experts make is completely wrong?</li>
  </ol>
<li>Can individual experts be evaluated to improve the prediction?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Can the individual bias of experts be evaluated and be adjusted for?</li>
    <li>Is there benefit to removing experts that don’t contribute to the prediction accuracy?</li>
  </ol>
<li>Can the predictions be enhanced through transfer learning where the prediction tasks of the experts are similar?</li>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Are there common domaine features for the predictions that experts or ensembles of experts make?</li>
    <li>Do instances in one time series serve as useful examples for training in another time series?</li>
    <li>Can different models over different time series be stacked to output a better prediction?</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
